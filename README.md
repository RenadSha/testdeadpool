## The assignment

* Check this wiki page about [social previews](https://cmd-viscom.gitbook.io/3-3-dataviz/wiki/social-previews) and implement the code linked in that article (it's the "gist" link) into your ```<head></head>```.
* Create a copy of your [Marvel head assignment](https://cmd-viscom.gitbook.io/3-3-dataviz/tutorial-technology/2-css-svg-and-github/werkcollege#opdracht-p-marvel-head).
* Add the correct meta tags to your `index.html` between `<head>` and `</head>`.
* Make sure you create a screenshot of the result in your assignment and edit it so it meets the requirements (maybe you could create a crop with a 2:1 aspect ratio).
* Upload this extra image to your repo as well.
* Use the complete URL for your image, so `[GH Pages URL]/filename.jpg`. You can check the source code in [this example](https://zuyd-bd08.github.io/marvel-head-1767569geurts/).
* You can test your GitHub Pages URL in [this twitter-card-validator](https://threadcreator.com/tools/twitter-card-validator). Or you could paste your URL in a teams chat to someone or yourself, to see if it works.
* Make sure you can see a decent title, description Ã¡nd image.
* After submitting your work **share your GitHub Pages URL in #Off-topic in Teams**

## Submitting your work
* Create a new branch called **gh-pages** and upload your local work into this branch.
* Start a new **pull request**, select one **reviewer** and make sure to put the **GitHub Pages URL** in the comment section. 
* Do **not** merge this Pull Request yourself. That's up to the reviewer to decide (merging is approving the assignment).
